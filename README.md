# TeenyTinyDB
I needed a very small database to use when I demo AzureSQL import/export functions. This is where TeenyTinyDB was born. 

It is a very small Visual Studio 2015 SSDT project designed for SQL Server 2016. It has one table, with three columns. In the post deployment script I populate the table with five of my favorite YouTubers. 

That's it, just a very small database that will export, upload and download quickly into Azure. This would be useful for anyone who needs a very small database to experiment with. 

If you don't want to download the solution, I've also included the database backup file (.BAK) as well as the BACPAC file so you can quickly use the database.
